Hi! I am a researcher at the [Max Planck Empirical Inference Department](https://is.mpg.de/employees/rperry). <br>
I am funded by a Fulbright Scholarship under the supervision of Dr. Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf. <br>
In my current work, I am using kernel-based hypothesis tests to learn causal structure and perform model selection when we have access to multiple datasets from varying interventions on the same underlying unknown structure. I also work on complexity measures and generalization bounds for piecewise linear functions such as random forests and ReLU neural networks.

Previously, I recevied my bachelors (Applied Math & Statistics, 2019) and masters (Biomedical Engineering, 2020) from Johns Hopkins University. <br>
As a student and then as a full time research assistant, I was fortunate enough to be advised by Dr. Joshua Vogelstein in the [NeuroData Lab](https://neurodata.io/about). <br>
My research concerned methods for data with certain structure (graphs, multilevel data, images/timeseries), nonparametric hypothesis testing applied to connectome data, calibrated random forests, and I led development of the first comprehensive Python library for machine learning on multiview data. 

In my free time, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/53839031), climbing, swing dancing, baking sourdough bread, board games, ultimate frisbee, and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107774777-rp).
