I am a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Washington.

Previously, I was a researcher the [Max Planck Empirical Inference Department](https://is.mpg.de/employees/rperry), funded by a Fulbright Scholarship and hosted by Dr. Bernhard Schölkopf, where I studied causal discovery from multi-environment data.

I received a B.S. and M.S.E from Johns Hopkins University where I was advised by Dr. Joshua Vogelstein in the [NeuroData Lab](https://neurodata.io/about). My research concerned random forests, hypothesis testing of fMRI data, the double descent phenomenon, and open source software development.

In my free time, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/53839031), climbing, swing dancing, board games, ultimate frisbee, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107774777-rp), and of course [traveling](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1rdoCbZ2kjhfwcyMsHvNRME3xW_HYIkDj&usp=sharing).


## News
- **06/2022** - Our paper "Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous Environments Under the Sparse Mechanism Shift Hypothesis" ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02013), [code](https://github.com/rflperry/sparse_shift)) is now available. The result of my Fulbright grant, in collaboration with Julius von Kügelgen and Bernhard Schölkopf at the Max Planck Institute in Tübingen.
- **02/2022**  - My [Python package](https://github.com/neurodata/honest-forests) for honest decision trees and forests is now available and scikit-learn compliant.
- **12/2021** - I serve as a volunteer at our Neurips [workshop](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021/ScheduleMultitrack?event=21852) on out-of-distribution generalization.
- **09/2021** - I have moved to Tübingen, Germany, to begin my Fulbright Fellowship with Bernhard Schölkopf.
- **09/2021** - [Our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00325) on the calibration of honest decision forests is now on arXiv.
