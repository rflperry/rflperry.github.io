I am a guest researcher at the [Max Planck Empirical Inference Department](https://is.mpg.de/employees/rperry) under the supervision of Dr. Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf and funded by a Fulbright Scholarship. I work on using kernel-based hypothesis tests to learn causal structure and perform model selection when we have access to multiple datasets from varying interventions on the same underlying unknown structure. I also work on complexity measures and generalization bounds for piecewise linear functions such as random forests and ReLU neural networks.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the Johns Hopkins [NeuroData Lab](https://neurodata.io/about) under the supervision of Dr. Joshua Vogelstein. There, I worked on methods for data with certain structure (graphs, multilevel data, images/timeseries), nonparametric hypothesis testing applied to connectome data, calibrated random forests, and developed the first comprehensive Python library for machine learning on multiview data. I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, both from Johns Hopkins University.

In my free time, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/53839031), climbing, swing dancing, baking sourdough bread, board games, ultimate frisbee, and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107774777-rp).
