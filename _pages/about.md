I am a guest researcher and Fulbright Scholar at the [Max Planck Empirical Inference Department](https://is.mpg.de/employees/rperry) in Germany. Previously, I was a research assistant with Dr. Joshua Vogelstein at the Johns Hopkins [NeuroData Lab](https://neurodata.io/about) where I received a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering. My current work is primarily on the topics of uncertainty quantification, causality, and generalization in the context of random forests and neural networks. I have previously worked on methods for data with structure (graphs, multilevel data, images/timeseries), nonparametric hypothesis testing, and the first comprehensive Python library for multiview data, and applications in the context of neuroscience connectome data.

In my free time, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/53839031), climbing, swing dancing, baking sourdough bread, board games, ultimate frisbee, and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107774777-rp).
