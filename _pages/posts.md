<!--| A friend's dilemma led me to an interesting application of my network science toolbox. It turns out, recipes are easily represented as a network. Take a look for an in depth analysis.-->

- Jan 02, 2019 \| [Network and sentiment analysis of US House of Representatives tweets](https://rflperry.github.io/socialgraphs2018/)
<!--| Ever wondered how partisan the US house of Representatives really is? It turns out that twitter provides some pretty interesting data and Python can help us understand said data. This work was inspired by material from a class I took at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Not only can we visualize the retweets of the individuals in the 2018 House as a network, we can examine their tweets too to analyze the sentiment within. -->
